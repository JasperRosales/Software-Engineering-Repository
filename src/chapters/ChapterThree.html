            <section>
               <p>Businesses now operate in a global, rapidly changing environment. They have to respond to new opportunities and markets, changing economic conditions, and the
                 emergence of competing products and services. Software is part of almost all business operations so new software is developed quickly to take advantage of new
                 opportunities and to respond to competitive pressure. Rapid development and delivery is therefore now often the most critical requirement for software systems. In fact,
                 many businesses are willing to trade off software quality and compromise on requirements to achieve faster deployment of the software that they need. </p>

                <p>Because these businesses are operating in a changing environment, it is often practically impossible to derive a complete set of stable software requirements. The initial
                   requirements inevitably change because customers find it impossible to predict how a system will affect working practices, how it will interact with other systems, and what
                   user operations should be automated. It may only be after a system has been delivered and users gain experience with it that the real requirements become clear. Even then,
                  the requirements are likely to change quickly and unpredictably due to external factors.The software may then be out of date when it is delivered.</p>

                
                <p>Software development processes that plan on completely specifying the requirements and then designing, building, and testing the system are not geared to rapid software
                    development. As the requirements change or as requirements problems are discovered, the system design or implementation has to be reworked and retested. As a consequence, a conventional waterfall or 
                    specification-based process is usually prolonged and the final software is delivered to the customer long after it was originally specified.</p>

                <p>For some types of software, such as safety-critical control systems, where a complete analysis of the system is essential, a plan-driven approach is the right one.
                   However, in a fast-moving business environment, this can cause real problems. By the time the software is available for use, the original reason for its procurement may
                   have changed so radically that the software is effectively useless. Therefore, for business systems in particular, development processes that focus on rapid software
                   development and delivery are essential. </p>

                <p>The need for rapid system development and processes that can handle changing
                   requirements has been recognized for some time. IBM introduced incremental development in the 1980s (Mills et al., 1980). The introduction of so-called fourthgeneration languages, also in the 1980s, supported the idea of quickly developing
                   and delivering software (Martin, 1981). However, the notion really took off in the late 1990s with the development of the notion of agile approaches such as DSDM
                  (Stapleton, 1997), Scrum (Schwaber and Beedle, 2001), and extreme programming (Beck, 1999; Beck, 2000).</p>

               </p>Rapid software development processes are designed to produce useful software quickly. The software is not developed as a single unit but as a series of increments, with
                    each increment including new system functionality. Although there are many
                    approaches to rapid software development, they share some fundamental characteristics:</p>
